Launch Countdown Timer

Super early release of this code.. and.. I'm a bit busy on other launch prep activities to be able to devote a lot of time beyond this release.  I built this entirely for my own use - as part of a [Launch Watch Party for the SpaceX DM2](https://www.spaceforhumanity.org/demo-2-launch-party) mission that I am helping produce.  


I'm running this on my own trusty image with Raspbian Stretch.  There may

Just clone the repo

Dependancies:  Python 2 / Pygame maybe some other stuff too.  Hope it installs easy for you! 

**Fonts**

Run the install-fonts.sh bash script (just copies fonts over to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/)
    sudo chmod +X install-fonts.sh
    sudo ./install-fonts.sh

**I install Pygame like this:**

    sudo apt-get -y install python-pygame

**Run it thus:**

    sudo python countdown.py

Just play around.  

Good luck!!!
